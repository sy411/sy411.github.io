  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website is about Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that might do well in the 2018 season.</p>
  <h2>Houston Astros</h2>
    <p>The Houston Astros will most likely do well in the '18 season because they won the World Series in the '17 season.</p>
    <p>They have Correa whose batting average was .315 last season,and he is a great shortstop.</p>
    <p>The amazing Altuve is on their team who had a batting average of .346 last season.</p>
    <p>Springer is also a great person on this team who had 34 home runs last season.</p>
    <p>Pitching wise, they have Verlander and McCullers Jr. who are both great pitchers.</p>
  <h3>Los Angeles Dodgers</h3>
    <p>The Dodgers made it to the World Series last season, so they might do well this season.</p>
    <p>They have Bellinger who had 39 home runs last season. He also set records too.</p>
    <p>Justin Turner is on their team also. He had a batting average of .322.</p>
    <p>Legendary Clayton Kershaw who had a ERA of 2.31 last season with 202 strikeouts.</p>
    <p>Wood who had a ERA of 2.72 will most likely do well this season.</p>
  <h4>New York Yankees</h4>
    <p>Judge who had 52 home runs last season will give the Yankees a advantage this season.</p>
    <p>The Yankees just got Stanton who had 59 home runs last season will also give the Yankees an advantage.</p>
    <p>In pitching, they have Severino, but besides that, their pitching could hurt them a bit.</p>
  <h5>Boston Red Sox</h5>
    <p>The Red Sox have Predoria, Betts, and Moreland, but they are really good at fielding.</p>
